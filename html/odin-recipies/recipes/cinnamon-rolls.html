        <p>You don't have to run to the mall to satisfy your craving for cinnamon rolls — soft and warm from the oven and drizzled with icing. We'll show you step by step how to make cinnamon rolls from scratch — from making the dough to filling, forming, baking, and icing — with loads of helpful tips along the way.</p>
        <p><b>Tips</b>: Be sure to measure out the butter for the filling and icing separately and let them come to room temperature so they'll be ready when you need them for the recipe.</p>

        <h2>How to Make Homemade Cinnamon Rolls</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the yeast dough. Once the dough has risen once, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Flatten the dough with the palms of your hands and gently stretch and/or roll it into a rectangle. Related: Learn how to proof yeast and work with yeast dough.</li>
            <li>Use a rolling pin (try this $16 Target.com best-seller) to roll the dough out into a larger rectangle, approximately 12 inches wide by 20 inches long. The dough might be sticky, so flour the work surface and the rolling pin, checking to be sure the dough isn't stuck to the work surface and adding more flour as necessary.</li>
            <li>Spread the softened butter over the surface of the dough, leaving a 1-inch strip along the long edge of the rectangle furthest away from you completely dry. (Other cinnamon roll recipes call for egg wash instead of butter; if you're using egg wash, brush the entire surface.)</li>
            <li>Generously sprinkle cinnamon-sugar over the butter, spreading the mixture evenly. Other spices, such as nutmeg and cardamom, also work well. Leave the 1-inch border free of sugar. Tip: Adding a pinch of ground cloves to the cinnamon-sugar mixture boosts the cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li>Add any other fillings you're using — raisins, nuts, shredded coconut, orange zest — taking care to distribute them evenly.</li>
            <li>Start at the left-hand corner of the edge closest to you. Working from left to right, tug the lip of the dough up and over the filling, keeping it tight. Roll up the dough, tightening the log as you go.</li>
            <li>When you reach the far edge of the dough, moisten the bare edge with egg wash or water and pinch to seal the seam.</li>
            <li>Use a serrated knife, pastry cutter, or length of unwaxed dental floss (our favorite method) to cut the dough into even-sized pieces. You might want to discard the very ends of the roll since they often contain little filling.</li>
            <li>Place the cut rolls on a greased or parchment-lined baking pan or cookie sheet.</li>
            <li>When the rolls have doubled in size, bake them in a preheated 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) oven. Cinnamon rolls are generally baked at a lower temperature than other breads — if the rolls are close together, the tops will begin to brown before the edges and centers are done. If the rolls begin browning too soon, cover pan with foil.</li>
            <li>After approximately 30 minutes, test for doneness. Use a paring knife or fork to pull up the center-most roll; if the dough is still sticky and raw-looking, return the pan to the oven for about ten more minutes. The rolls should be golden to dark brown on top, and fully baked in the center of the coil.</li>
            <li>Cool the pan on a rack about 10 to 15 minutes before icing the rolls.</li>
